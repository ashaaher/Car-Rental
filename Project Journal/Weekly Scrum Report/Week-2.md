  **1. Communication (Owner - Asha)**

  We decided to make Zoom call on every Thursday after our CMPE 202 class, so that we can discuss the lectures and related information to our project. In the first Zoom meeting we planned our weekly tasks and divided those tasks amongst each other. In the second meeting we designed a high level 
User Interface and discussed the challenges and tried to solve them and also discussed the individual's progress.

a. What tasks did I work on / complete?- Designed User Interface.

b. What am I planning to work on next?- Design Diagrams .

c. What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?- None.

  **2. Simplicity (Owner - Jumana)**

  For simplicity sake we divided the tasks up to the granular level and ensured that every is having one task in his plate and no one is doing more than one task at a time. As we are a group of 4, we divided two people to start working on UI and other two on Backend.
